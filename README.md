## Covid-19 has now become the talk of the town, Like most people in the world right now are suffering badly and everyday thousand's of people are dying because of it, Iâ€™m genuinely worried about them. So, rather than sitting idle and let negative thoughts grow day by day,I decided to do what I do best .In the above project i used data with classes people wearing mask and no mask and trained a mobilenet V2, then i used the model to predict on a webcam feed

# Face Mask Detector
   Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams. 

## Tech/framework used
    OpenCV
    TensorFlow
    MobileNetV2

# Usage:

   Step 1: Training the model with the appropriate data with Face_mask_detector.ipynb, downloading the model weights.

   Step 2: Run detect.ipynb, the webcam is used for output.
